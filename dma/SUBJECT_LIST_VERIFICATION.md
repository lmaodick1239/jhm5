## 📚 Category B: Applied Learning

**Official Count:** 80+ Applied Learning courses

The official HKEAA website lists **80+ Applied Learning courses** across six areas:

2. **Math Extended Parts:** Treated as **separate elective subjects** (students can take both M1 and M2)
3. **Applied Learning:** Over 80 courses exist, but we use a **general category** in the calculator
4. **Category C:** Subject list **changes by year** - verify against HKEAA for each exam year
5. **Phased Out Subjects:** Combined Science and Integrated Science **no longer offered** (last 2023)
6. **CSD vs Liberal Studies:** CSD uses **different grading** (Attained/Not Attained, not 1-5**)
