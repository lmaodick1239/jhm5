# Percentile Calculation Enhancement

## Overview
The DSE Calculator now includes **accurate percentile calculations** based on official 2024 HKDSE statistics from table3f data. Users can compare their Best 5 scores against the actual Hong Kong student population.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Accurate Percentile Calculation ✅
- **Data Source**: Official 2024 HKDSE Results Statistics (table3f_en.csv)
- **Calculation Method**: Uses cumulative distribution from actual exam results
- **Precision**: Matches exact score ranges from HKEAA data

### 2. Two Comparison Modes ✅
Users can toggle between:
- **Day School Candidates**: 40,666 candidates (18,027 qualified)
- **All Candidates**: 49,026 candidates (18,850 qualified)

### 3. Detailed Statistics Display ✅
For each Best 5 score, users see:
- **Percentile Rank**: What percentage of students they performed better than
- **Students Below**: Exact number of students with lower scores
- **Students Above**: Exact number of students with higher scores  
- **Score Range**: Which score bracket (e.g., "29/28/27") they fall into
- **Students in Range**: How many students share their score range
- **Performance Rating**: Message with emoji (🌟, ⭐, 🎯, 👍, 📚, 💪)

### 4. Visual Enhancements ✅
- **Interactive Toggle**: Switch between day school and all candidates
- **Progress Bar**: Visual percentile ranking
- **Color-Coded Chips**: 
  - 🟢 Green (Success) = Top 10% (90th percentile+)
  - 🔵 Blue (Primary) = Top 30% (70th percentile+)
  - 🟡 Yellow (Warning) = Top 50% (50th percentile+)
  - 🔴 Red (Danger) = Below 50th percentile
- **Three Statistics Cards**: Quick stats at a glance

## Technical Implementation

### New Files Created

#### 1. `src/utils/percentileData.ts`
Main utility file for percentile calculations:

```typescript
// Key exports:
export interface Best5Distribution { ... }
export const best5DistributionData: Best5Distribution[]
export const totalCandidates = { daySchool: 40666, allCandidates: 49026 }
export const qualifiedCandidates = { daySchool: 18027, allCandidates: 18850 }

export function calculatePercentileFromData(
  score: number,
  useDaySchool: boolean = true
): {
  percentile: number;
  totalStudents: number;
  studentsBelow: number;
  studentsAbove: number;
  scoreRange: string;
}

export function getPercentileMessage(percentile: number): {
  message: string;
  emoji: string;
  color: 'success' | 'primary' | 'warning' | 'danger';
}

export function getScoreRangeStats(score: number, useDaySchool: boolean = true)
```

### Updated Files

#### 1. `src/utils/calculator.ts`
- Added imports from `percentileData.ts`
- Re-exports percentile functions for convenience
- Updated `calculatePercentile()` to use new data-driven approach

#### 2. `src/components/ResultsDashboard.tsx`
Major enhancements:
- Added `useState` for day school toggle
- Integrated `calculatePercentileFromData()` function
- Added three new statistics cards showing:
  - Students beaten
  - Score range and count
  - Performance rating
- Added toggle switch for candidate type selection
- Added contextual message showing total candidates and qualifiers

- [ ] Gender-based comparisons
- [ ] School type comparisons (government, aided, direct subsidy)
- [ ] Regional comparisons
- [ ] Trend analysis over years

### Phase 3 Ideas:
- [ ] University programme admission percentiles
- [ ] "What if" scenario calculator (e.g., "If I got 5 instead of 4 in Math...")
- [ ] PDF report export with percentile details
- [ ] Share results with shareable URL
- [ ] Save multiple result sets for comparison

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Test Cases:
1. **Score 35**: Should show "Top 0.7%", 283 cumulative
2. **Score 30**: Should show "Top 2.3%", 926 cumulative
3. **Score 27**: Should show "Top 5.4%", 2,179 cumulative
4. **Score 24**: Should show "Top 10.6%", 4,317 cumulative
5. **Score 21**: Should show "Top 19.6%", 7,965 cumulative
6. **Score 18**: Should show "Top 31.6%", 12,852 cumulative
7. **Score 15**: Should show "Top 41.5%", 16,863 cumulative
8. **Score 12**: Should show "Top 44.3%", 18,027 cumulative

### Toggle Test:
- Switch from "Day School" to "All Candidates"
- Numbers should change from 18,027 total to 18,850 total
- Percentages may shift slightly (usually within 1-2%)

## Conclusion

The enhanced percentile calculation feature transforms the DSE Calculator from a simple score calculator into a comprehensive **benchmark tool** that provides:
- ✅ Accurate placement data
- ✅ Meaningful context
- ✅ Actionable insights
- ✅ Visual clarity
- ✅ Official statistics backing

This feature is **production-ready** and based entirely on official HKEAA 2024 data. 🎓📊
