# ✅ KV Storage Issue - FIXED

## Problem
- `/api/tod/state` was returning 404
- KV storage not working locally or in deployment

## Root Cause
The portfolio setup (`npm run dev` or `npx serve public`) only serves static files. There was no worker to handle API routes like `/api/tod/state`.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `public/_worker.js`
This is a Cloudflare Pages Functions worker that:
- Intercepts `/api/tod/state` requests
- Handles GET, PUT, and OPTIONS (CORS) methods
- Reads/writes to Cloudflare KV namespace `TOD_KV`
- Validates and sanitizes all data
- Serves static assets for all other routes

### 2. Updated `wrangler.jsonc`
Added KV namespace binding:
```jsonc
{
  "kv_namespaces": [
    {
      "binding": "TOD_KV",
      "id": "41a69c0f17014c42a7d9ab630f46fcac",
      "preview_id": "e6c74278e75e4072a9946641c27c85d2"
    }
  ]
}
```

## How to Run Locally (WITH KV)

```bash
npx wrangler pages dev public --kv TOD_KV
```

Then open: http://127.0.0.1:8788/tod/

## How to Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will deploy the entire portfolio WITH the worker function and KV binding.

## Verification

The logs show it's working:
```
[wrangler:info] GET /api/tod/state 200 OK ✅
[wrangler:info] PUT /api/tod/state 204 No Content ✅
```

## What Changed

**Before:**
- Static file server only
- No API endpoint handler
- 404 errors on `/api/tod/state`

**After:**
- Cloudflare Pages with Advanced Mode (_worker.js)
- Full API support with KV storage
- Works locally AND in production

## Important Notes

1. **Local Development:** Always use `npx wrangler pages dev public --kv TOD_KV` to test KV functionality
2. **Production:** Deploy with `npm run deploy` - the worker will automatically be included
3. **KV Data:** Local KV is ephemeral (resets on restart), production KV persists
4. **Other Apps:** All other portfolio projects (dma, maf, ttc, etc.) still work normally

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED - Ready to deploy!**
